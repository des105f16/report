In this chapter we will present the needed background information which serves as the base for our project.
We will, based on our pre-specialization \cite{prespecialization}, introduce some of the security problems found in the Internet-of-Things (IoT).
Specifically, we will look into privacy issues associated with IoT.
We will also discuss the possibility of handling some of these privacy issues with time-based constraints.
Additionally, we will discuss some problems related to the development of secure software.
Finally, we will present two code examples, which will be used throughout the report, to serve as IoT use-cases.
The following presentation of our solution will be based on these running examples.
