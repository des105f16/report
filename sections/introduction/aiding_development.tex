\section{Aiding development of secure software}
When developing any kind of software, developers must take many things into account.
Even when developing software using high abstraction programming languages and/or frameworks, a lot can go wrong when having to take into account the multitudes of aspects related to a problem domain.
If we also add security, specifically the modeling of security policies, even more can go wrong if not properly handled.

Applying more tools and techniques to ensure security can be cumbersome and time-consuming, and could ultimately end up in complete omission if it requires too much effort.
This is why we would like to create a tool which could assist developers in gaining more insights to the security aspects of the software to be written.
We imagine the use of the tool being as seamless as possible, as to not diminish its usefulness.

We will develop a tool, which will give the user the ability to actively create and modify security policies while implementing software, and receive feedback about breaches of these, in similar style of a modern IDE displaying compiler errors.
We will take a bottom-up approach, in order to maintain high usability for the programmer, such as ourselves.
This tool will be based on the security policies of the Decentralized Label Model (DLM), with a focus on inferring labels.
Additionally, we will introduce our simple time policies, as an extension to the DLM policies, which will be similarly usable and provide similar feedback about time-breaches.
The tool will allow for applying these security policies to C programs, as C is a widely used language for low level implementations, such as an IoT device.
