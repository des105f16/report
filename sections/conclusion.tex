In this report we have provided a formalization of the static label checking of the Decentralized Label Model.
We have provided a formal set of semantic functions describing the constraints that are associated with a program.
By further specifying default label values for any missing label declaration we are able to apply this specification to both labeled and unlabeled programs.
This is achieved through an algorithm that infers labels for these missing label declarations.
The algorithm is originally described in \cite{myers1997}.
In this report we have presented an actual algorithm that replicates this description.

All of the above have been implemented in a tool for checking information flow in programs.
Using simple constructs they have been created as an extension of the C programming language.
This language was chosen in order to provide a simple-to-use security model for a low level language, that is used for embedded devices.

Trough the development process we have continuously experimented with the use of labels in programs.
Because of this hands-on experience the tool has been developed bottom-up, with a focus on what the programmer requires.
The result of this is a tool that provides feedback for the programmer similar to a modern IDE.
This feedback describes if any information flow policies are invalid or could not be determined through inference.

Further we have developed a set of language constructs for describing time policies alongside the exist labels.
When developing these time constructs, the focus on programmer-first was maintained.
This resulted in a minimalistic, yet quite expressive, set of time policy constructs for the language.
Furthermore we have demonstrated how these policies can be represented as timed automata, providing a formalism that is associated with much existing theory.

In the following we will discuss some of the difficulties we have noted in our work with DLM and time policies.
These range from issues that we would have liked to have solved with our tool, to some that would require a different type of tool than the one we have created.

%- Principal hierarchy
%-- Possibly with time restrictions
%- Integrity
%- Run-time check code generation
%-- Race conditions
%- Model-checking
%-- Content-based
%- Maybe, checks for 'dangerous operations' e.g. input from console/file/etc.
