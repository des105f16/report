In this section we will present the \thelanglong language, hereafter referred to simply as \thelang.

\thelang~ is based upon C99\mikael{Or some other variant?} and will extend the syntax of C with the concept of labels, as discussed in the previous chapters.
Firstly, we will present the scope under which we have limited our implementation.
Then we will informally present \thelang~ without going into much details on the implementation, but rather focus on usage.
Lastly we will present the specifics of extracting labels and constraints, used for the inference algorithm presented in \Cref{dlm:inference_algorithm}.
