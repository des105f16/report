\section{Security problems}
In \cite{prespecialization} we investigated problems involving the imminent implementation of smart meters throughout Europe.
Here we discovered a wide array of problems, ranging from ethical to practical.
One of the more interesting points was the newly acquired problems associated with increasing the availability of a physically isolated device.
This is exactly what is going to happen when the locally interacted electrical meters are going to be substituted with remotely accessed and controlled smart meters.
It will open up for problems already found in similar devices, which in general is any internet-connected (IoT) device.
One of the focuses we had in \cite{prespecialization} was on the privacy issues related to such an exposed device.
We would like to further explore this problem, while coming up with a solution which will start towards aiding in the securing of privacy in IoT devices.
Many of the security problems associated with privacy could possibly also be minimized by adding the concept of time restraints, why we will also discuss this here.
