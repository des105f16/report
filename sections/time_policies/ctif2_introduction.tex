In this chapter we will extend our previous description of \thelang{} with the use of time policies.
The same concepts as previous still hold, as we want a simple way of declaring time policies to certain values in a program, in order to restrict the access to these values.

We will make a proposal of a practical extension of the previously discussed security labels, extended with time policies.
After both informal and formal descriptions of these new time policies, we will show how they can be translated into timed automata, so that relevant theory may still apply.
We will also, maybe, show how \thelang{} compares to TDLM.
