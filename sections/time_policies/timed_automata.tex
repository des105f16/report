\section{Timed Automata}\label{automata}
As the first step towards formalising the time policies of \thelang, we will show how they can be translated into timed automata.
Before doing so in \cref{automata:timepolicies}, we will first shortly define and describe timed automata, based on \cite{alur1994theory}.

The timed automata is an extension to the $\omega$-automata formalism, allowing for the manipulation of clock-variables, as well as clock-based constraints.
The formal definition for a timed automaton can be seen in \cref{time:def:timedautomaton}.

\begin{definition}{Timed automaton}\label{time:def:timedautomaton}
A timed automaton is a tuple $(\Sigma, S, S_0, C, E)$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet,
  \item $S$ is a finite set of states,
  \item $S_0 \subseteq S$ is a set of start states,
  \item $C$ is a finite set of clocks, and
  \item $E \subseteq S \times S \times \Sigma \times 2^C \times \phi(C)$ gives the set of transitions. \\
    An edge $(s, s', \sigma, \lambda, \delta)$ represents a transition from state $s$ to state $s'$ on input symbol $\sigma$.
    The set $\lambda \subseteq C$ gives the clocks to be reset with this transition, and $\delta$ is a clock constraint over C.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

In \cref{time:ex:visualrepresentation} can be seen a visualization of a timed automaton.
Generally, for each edge we have the input $\sigma$, clock resets $\lambda$, and clock constraints $\phi(C)$.
In our automata, the input will represent the action of reading a value with the corresponding name.
Clock resets are denoted $x := 0$, which corresponds to $\lambda = \{ x \}$, and in this case will reset the clock variable $x$ to 0.
Clock constraints are denoted $(x >= 10m)?$, which is a single clock constraint for the clock variable $x$.
Several input characters, clock resets, and clock constraints can be defined for a single edge, the syntax is used to distinct between them.
It should also be noted that, in our clock constraints, we will use the same concept of time factors as those described for our time policies (see \cref{time:expressiveness}).

\begin{example}{Visual representation}\label{time:ex:visualrepresentation}
In this example we have a timed automata with the following characteristica:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma = \{ v \} \cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
  \item $S = \{ s_0, s_1 \}$
  \item $S_0 = \{ s_0 \}$
  \item $C = \{ x \}$
  \item $E = \{ (s_0, s_1, v, \{ x \}, \emptyset), (s_1, s_0, \varepsilon, \emptyset, \{ 10m \geq x \})\}$
\end{itemize}
This timed automaton is concerned with protecting the value of $v$, which should be read with at least 10 minutes inbetween reads.
We start in state $s_0$, with all clock variables initially set to $0$ (although this is not important for this example).
At some point, we can make the transition from $s_0$ to $s_1$, which is an unconstrained transition.
Once we do this $x$ will be reset and we perform the action of reading $v$.
Now, in $s_1$, we cannot transition back to $s_0$ before we have waited for at least 10 minutes, hence the constraint on the edge going from $s_1$ to $s_0$.
Once enough time has passed, we can carry out the transition and from there we are again permitted to perform the transition from $s_0$ to $s_1$ in order to read $v$.

\subsection{Time policies and timed automata}\label{automata:timepolicies}
In this section, we will show how it is possible to transform \thelang{} time policies into timed automata.
This will be done by defining several abstract time policies, representing any variation, and showing for each of these a corresponding timed automaton.

We assume having a special clock variable $\tau_s$ representing the current system time, which will be used for evaluating period constraints.
For readability purposes, whenever we have a time policy with a period $(p_s, p_e)$ we will use the constraint $\delta_p$, representing our period constraint:
\[ \delta_p = (p_s \leq \tau_s < p_e) \]
along with its negation
\[ \lnot\delta_p = (p_s > \tau_s \geq p_e) \]

\subsubsection{Period}
A period-only policy is represented as a tuple $(p_s, p_e, \infty)$, since we previously defined it as having an implicit count value of $c = \infty$.
In this case, however, $c = \infty$ simply means that we can read without further restrictions, as long as our period constraint holds.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{figures/timed_automata/general_period.tikz}
  \caption{Abstract period-only policy}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Interval}
An interval-only policy is represented by a tuple $(i, 1)$, with the implicit count value of $c = 1$.
We will now need a clock variable in order to limit the number of consecutive reads.
Additionally, $s_1$ will now also represent a state in which the first (and in this case only) read has been performed.
The automaton can now be stuck in state $s_1$, while waiting for the interval constraint to be fulfilled.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{figures/timed_automata/general_interval.tikz}
  \caption{Abstract interval-only policy (with implicit $c = 1$)}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Period and count}
Similar to the interval-only policy, when extending a period-only policy with a specific count: $(p_s, p_e, c)$, we will need a state for each count in order to represent how many consecutive reads have been performed.
Unlike the interval-only policy, we do not need a clock variable.
Instead, we need only ensure the period constraint for each read, as well as reset (by returning to $s_0$) whenever we are no longer within the period.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{figures/timed_automata/general_period_2count.tikz}
  \caption{Abstract policy with a period and count}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Interval and count}
When extending an interval-only policy with a specific count, something interesting happens.
In order to visualize this, we will here make us of a concrete count, so that we have a policy: $(i, 2)$.
This results in 4 states, one state representing each possible combination of consecutive reads, having that we have performed reads: none, first only, first followed by second, second only, second followed by first (after a reset).

Generally, we will have $2^c$ states, and the ability to transition from any state where we either perform a new read or the clock variable for a former read has been reset.

  \centering
  \input{figures/timed_automata/general_interval_2count.tikz}
  \caption{Abstract policy with interval and count ($c = 2$)}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Period, interval, and count}
If we now try to combine all three time policy constituents, while still having a concrete count: $(p_s, p_e, i, 2)$, we can see that little change is needed.
