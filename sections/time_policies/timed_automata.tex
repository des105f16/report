\section{Timed Automata}\label{automata}
Here we will shortly define and describe timed automata, based on \cite{alur1994theory}.

The timed automata is an extension to the $\omega$-automata formalism, allowing for the manipulation of clock-variables, as well as clock-based restrictions.
The formal definition for a timed automaton can be seen in \cref{time:def:timedautomaton}.

\begin{definition}{Timed automaton}\label{time:def:timedautomaton}
A timed automaton is a tuple $(\Sigma, S, S_0, C, E)$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet,
  \item $S$ is a finite set of states,
  \item $S_0 \subseteq S$ is a set of start states,
  \item $C$ is a finite set of clocks, and
  \item $E \subseteq S \times S \times \Sigma \times 2^C \times \phi(C)$ gives the set of transitions. \\
    An edge $(s, s', \sigma, \lambda, \delta)$ represents a transition from state $s$ to state $s'$ on input symbol $\sigma$.
    The set $\lambda \subseteq C$ gives the clocks to be reset with this transition, and $\delta$ is a clock constraint over C.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

In \cref{time:ex:visualrepresentation} can be seen a visualization of a timed automaton.
Generally, for each edge we have the input $\sigma$, clock resets $\lambda$, and clock constraints $\phi(C)$.
In our examples, the input will symbolize an action performed along with the transition, reading a value with the corresponding name.
Clock resets are denoted $x := 0$, which corresponds to $\lambda = \{ x \}$, and will reset the clock variable $x$ to 0.
Finally, clock constraints are declared, denoted $(x >= 10m)?$, which is a single clock constraint for the clock variable $x$.
Several input characters, clock resets, and clock constraints can be defined for a single edge, the syntax should make it clear which are which.
It should also be noted that the time constants used will use the same time factors as those described for our time policies (see \cref{time:expressiveness}).

\begin{example}{Visual representation}\label{time:ex:visualrepresentation}
In this example we have a timed automata with the following characteristica:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma = \{ v \} \cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
  \item $S = \{ s_0, s_1 \}$
  \item $S_0 = \{ s_0 \}$
  \item $C = \{ x \}$
  \item $E = \{ (s_0, s_1, v, \{ x \}, \emptyset), (s_1, s_0, \varepsilon, \emptyset, \{ 10m \geq x \})\}$
\end{itemize}
This timed automaton is concerned with protecting the value of $v$, which should be read with at least 10 minutes inbetween reads.
We start in state $s_0$, with all clock variables initially set to $0$ (although this is not important for this example).
At some point, we make the transition from $s_0$ to $s_1$, which is an unrestricted transition, $x$ will be reset and we perform the action of reading $v$.
Now, in $s_1$, we cannot transition back to our initial state before we have waited for at least 10 minutes, hence the restriction on the edge going from $s_1$ to $s_0$.
Once enough time has passed, we can carry out the transition and once again we are permitted to perform the first transition in order to read $v$.

\subsection{Time policies and timed automata}\label{automata:timepolicies}

\begin{definition}{General \thelang{} Time Policy Timed Automaton}
  If we have a general time policy:
  \[(p_s, p_e, i, c)\]

  Then we can define a timed automaton:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Sigma = \{ v \} \cup \{ \varepsilon \}$
    \item $S = \{ s_0 \} \cup \{ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_c \}$
    \item $S_0 = \{ s_0 \}$
    \item $C = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_c \} \cup \{ \tau_s \}$
    \item $\begin{aligned}E =& \{ (s_0, s_1, v, \{ x_1 \}, \{ \delta_p \}), (s_1, s_2, v, \{ x_2 \}, \{ \delta_p \}), \dots, (s_{c-1}, s_c, v, \{ x_c \}, \{ \delta_p \})\} \\ &\cup \{ (s_1, s_0, \varepsilon, \emptyset, \{ x_1 \geq i \}), (s_2, s_0, \varepsilon, \emptyset, \{ x_2 \geq i \}), \dots, (s_c, s_0, \varepsilon, \emptyset, \{ x_c \geq i \}) \}\end{aligned}$
  \end{itemize}

  Where we have the period clock constraint $\delta_p$ defined as \[p_s \leq \tau_s \leq p_e\]
  and $\tau_s$ represents the system time.
\end{definition}
