In this chapter we will set the context for our project.
We will, based on our pre-specialization \cite{prespecialization}, introduce some security problems in IoT.
Specifically, we will look into privacy issues often associated with IoT.
Additionally, we will discuss the possibility of handling some of these privacy issues with time-based constraints.
We will also shortly discuss the problems related to the development of secure software.
After introducing these problems we will present two code examples, which will be used throughout the report, to serve as IoT use-cases.
On these examples we will base the presentation of our solution.
