In this chapter we will introduce the problem domain in which we want to provide a solution.
We will, based on our pre-specialization \cite{prespecialization}, introduce security problems in IoT.
Specifically, we will look into privacy issues often associated with IoT, and investigate how to apply security policies to lessen the emerging of such problems.
Additionally, we will further this investigation by looking into the possibility of handling such privacy issues with time constraints.

After introducing these problems we will present two code examples which will be used throughout the report to serve as examples of IoT usage.
On these examples we will base the presentation of our solution.
